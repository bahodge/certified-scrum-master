# Certified Scrum Master

////////////////////////////////// Day 1 //////////////////////////////////

## Agile

There is no "doing agile" it is "being agile". Being able to adapt to changes. A change in the mindset.

## Terms

- Product Backlog
  - Everything goes here, this is a product wishlist.
- Burndown Chart
  - A way to measure progress through the sprint. This should be updated by the Development Team.
- Waterfall Method
  - Works great with known requirements. Terrible at unknown requirements.
- Empirical Process
  - Based on facts and observations

## Workbook

### Things to study

- Page 4
- Page 9

### The Agile Manifesto

Page 4. Agile principles and values

#### Values

- Individuals and interactions **OVER** processes and tools
- Responding to change **OVER** following a plan
- working software **OVER** comprehensive documentation
- Customer collaboration **OVER** contract negotiation

#### Empirical Process

3 Pillars of scrum: Transparency, Inspection & Adaptation.

TRANSPARENCY - outcomes -> INSPECTION - feedback -> Adaptation -> ....

- Transparency: Team commits to being transparent on what work must be done
- Inspection: Examination of work
- Adaptation: Changing the approach to solving an issue

### Scrum Framework

Was developed 25 Years ago. 3 Roles, 5 Events & 3 Artifacts

- Roles: How
- Events: Tools
- Artifacts: Techniques

#### Scrum Values

- Courage
- Focus
- Commitment
- Respect
- Openness

#### Scrum Roles

- Product Owner: Business/Domain Expert. Person who decides the priority of what the team should work on
- Development Team: Team who actually puts work into the tasks during the sprint
- Scrum Master: Guide to keep the teams in sync and keeps the team on track

#### Events

- Sprint (The timebox of work)
- Sprint Planning (decide what will happen during the sprint)
- Daily Scrum (what work will happen for the day)
- Sprint Review (demo to stakeholders and get feedback)
- Sprint Retrospective (Product owner, Development Team and scrum master only)

#### Artifacts

- Product Backlog (Overall tasks for the product)
- Sprint Backlog (Tasks to be completed during the sprint)
- Product Increment (what is delivered)

#### Inspect and Adapt Activity

- Backlog Refinement (Happens at whatever interval the team wants. Must have Development Team and product owner)

### What is the Product Backlog

- PBI: Product backlog items
- Product owners are responsible for maintaining the the product backlog
- Product Backlog should implement `DEEP`
  - Detailed Appropriately
  - Emergent: Dynamically evolving
  - Estimated: By the Development Team
  - Priority: Where does it fall in the priority tree
- Every PBI should have the `DOVE` template
  - Detailed description
  - Order: Dependency tree
  - Value: Why is it a priority
  - Estimate: How long will it take to finish the PBI (metric determined by the team)
- Use `MuSCow` Prioritize
  - Must haves
  - Should haves
  - Could Have
  - Will not have

### Technical Debt

Invisible to most of the stakeholders. It is generated every time the team takes shortcuts or does not adhear to standards. Technical Debt comes from various sources, some of which can be good and some bad. It impedes progress.
